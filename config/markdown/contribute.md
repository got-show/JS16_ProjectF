WHAT IT IS

A song of Ice and Data provides statistical information about the World of Ice and Fire and the impact it has on ours. Should we be worried about Sansa Stark? Where exactly has Jon Snow travelled? And how many tweets were written about Hound?

HOW IT STARTED

Being huge machine learning nerds at [TU Munichâ€™s](https://www.tum.de/) [chair of Bioinformatics](https://rostlab.org/) and GoT fans, we wanted to use our data-crunching skills to get new insights into our beloved series. We also had to prepare material for a [JavaScript seminar](https://rostlab.org/owiki/index.php/Javascript_technology_2019) that we run each semester. Long story short, we decided to let our students build this web service, improving their knowledge of JavaScript in the process! The initial version was developed by the seminar in 2016 and the current version by the seminar in 2019.

DIVIDING TEAMS

The current version was developed by four teams. One team gathered the data from our Wiki-sources, two teams 2 used machine learning approaches to make predictions and one team was in charge of the website and integration.
In the initial version from 2016, the students were also divided into several teams: 2 teams used machine learning approaches to calculate Likelihood of Death for each character, 2 teams used sentiment analysis of tweets to deduce how fans feel about GoT characters and 1 team plotted charachters' footsteps on the GoT map using data mining.

Furthermore, 2 teams were in charge of continuous integration of individual projects and 2 teams assembled everything into the initial got.show app.

OPEN SOURCE & OPEN DATA PROJECT

Our results amused and pleased us, so we decided to share our findings with the fandom!
Now it's your turn - use the data we made available and build beautiful useful apps about the GoT world!

# Community
It always feels better with friends, right? So, how about joining our growing community of developers and contributors who help make the World of Ice and Fire data accessible to all fans?  

Are you a renowned expert on the geography of Essos? Do you know where exactly was the Battle of the Burning Mill? Found a mistake in one of the locations we put on the map? Then why not **use our [map editor](https://map.got.show)** to chart paths for less known characters and highlight landmarks where major events took place?
